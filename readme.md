# ComfyUI nodes to use [LivePortrait](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait) Vid2Vid but better

I have converted all the pickle files to safetensors: https://huggingface.co/Kijai/LivePortrait_safetensors/tree/main

They go here (and are automatically downloaded if the folder is not present) `ComfyUI/models/liveportrait`


Insightface is also required.
If you have a working compile environment, installing it can be as easy as:

`pip install insightface`

or for the portable version, in the ComfyUI_windows_portable -folder:

`python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install insightface`

If this fails (and it's likely), you can check the Troubleshooting part of the reactor node for alternative:

For insightface model, extract this to `ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l`:
